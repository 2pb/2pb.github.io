It’s a good time to learn and introduce those must-have sources to the “old fasion” system.The initial design looks like:online platform initial design ProsThe initial design has 5 distributed services running as clusters, they are WEB, SSO, ORDER, SEARCH and backend data MANAGEMENT. As a classic MVC system, it tries some technologies to handle High-Available(HA) scenario:a NGINX based LB will work as port-forwarding when user traffic comes from the frontend.an open source search engine Lucene/Solr is built to handle fussy query.a cluster of redis is used as SSO storage and context wide cache system.A splitting of read/write on Mysql db is also implemented to handle huge user traffic. ConsOverkilled distributed systems. The deploy and develo process is somewhat complicated.Local disk based file handling mechanism.Log collection is not implementd.Centrolized Mysql cluster.Lack of transaction consistency as distributed lock is not well implementd. OptimizationBased on the current cons and new cutting-edge techs, several optimization I will try to cover in the future work:Micro service. SpringCloud/SpringBoot.Container deployment. Docker/K8s.Distributed lock implementation.Log collection. Kafka.Distributed File System. fastdfsSharding. MycatOther optimizations.A new architecture will look like:online platform revised design","categories":[{"name":"Architecture","slug":"Architecture","permalink":"https://2pb.github.io/categories/Architecture/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Java","slug":"Java","permalink":"https://2pb.github.io/tags/Java/"},{"name":"Backend","slug":"Backend","permalink":"https://2pb.github.io/tags/Backend/"},{"name":"Design","slug":"Design","permalink":"https://2pb.github.io/tags/Design/"},{"name":"Optimization","slug":"Optimization","permalink":"https://2pb.github.io/tags/Optimization/"}]},{"title":"First Blog","slug":"first-blog","date":"2020-05-11T06:03:00.000Z","updated":"2020-05-13T04:53:37.722Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/05/10/first-blog/","link":"","permalink":"https://2pb.github.io/2020/05/10/first-blog/","excerpt":"Hello world!I created this brand new blog for a new learning session.","text":"Hello world!I created this brand new blog for a new learning session.This has been my fourth year of being a software engineer in US.
